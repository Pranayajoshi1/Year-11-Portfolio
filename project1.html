<h2>I addressed this by:</h2>
<ul> <li> I will make the background-color goods.
   </li>
  <h3><li> Color Palette Selection:</h3> I will choose a cohesive color palette that enhances the overall aesthetic of my low poly character. Consider the mood and theme I want to convey and select colors accordingly. Limiting the number of colors can help maintain visual coherence and reinforce the simplicity of the design.</li>
  <h3><li> Texture and Detailing:</h3> As a matter of fact low-poly characters usually have no or very small details but strategically detailed textures make my visual interest a bit complex without making the design much complicated.  I will put some detailed about the head part and the torso.</li>
